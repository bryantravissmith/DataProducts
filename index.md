## The Problem

Almost all physics classes show the following equations:

1. $$x_f = x_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$$
2. $$v_f = v_i + a t$$
3. $$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2} \left( v_i + v_f \right) t$$
4. $$v^2_f = v^2_i + 2 x \Delta x$$

## Inadequate Solutions

Flashing plots of kinemeatics data for different situations is pretty common  This shows the height of the ball as a function of time that is thrown straight up with 10 m/s.  

Mastered it yet?

## Feel Free to Share

With the shiny 1DKinPlot app student can finally see how changing the variables change
the resultings plots and behaviors of objects in 1D motion.
